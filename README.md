## How am I impacting the environment? Footsteps is an application that seeks to quantify the impact of our daily lifestyle choices on climate change.

# What it does?
* Integrates with other apps to get data on your daily habits
* Notifies you whenever you visit a place to input your data (e.g what you ate when you visit McDonalds)
* Gives you a report on your average recent emissions and what would happen if everyone did as you did
* Generates a plan on how to improve your lifestyle and be more eco-friendly
